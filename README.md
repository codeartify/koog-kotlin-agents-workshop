# Building AI Agents with Koog and Kotlin

This workshop repository contains a staff-facing membership operations assistant built with Koog, Kotlin, Spring Boot,
Angular, Event Sourcing, CQRS, and Kafka. The agent can investigate customer and membership data with read-only tools,
cite a semantic event-history projection, and prepare an action proposal. Deterministic Kotlin code validates the
proposal; no mutating membership tool is exposed.

## Workshop Baseline

This independent workshop repository preserves the reachable Git history of the `solutions` branch from
`https://github.com/codeartify/devopsdays2026.git` at source commit
`c63662f725c459659966eac290ec461f26f1734a`. The source commit is also marked by the annotated
`workshop-source-baseline` tag.

The baseline is pinned to Spring Boot 3.5.14, Kotlin 2.3.21, Java 25 (including the Java source/target and Kotlin JVM
target), and Axon Framework 5.1.0. Use the build and service startup commands documented below to verify it.

## Services

- `identity` on `http://localhost:8082`
    - manages customers
    - persists customer read models in PostgreSQL
    - publishes customer registration integration events to Kafka

- `fitness_management_system` on `http://localhost:8081`
    - manages plans and memberships
    - stores Axon events and membership projections in PostgreSQL
    - consumes customer integration events from Kafka
    - issues billing events when memberships are activated
    - notifies customers about invoices
    - hosts the Koog membership staff assistant at `/api/staff-assistant`

- `staff_console` on `http://localhost:4200`
    - provides the Angular 22 staff conversation UI
    - shows the structured case assessment, evidence, safe actions, warnings, and tool trace

## Infrastructure

- PostgreSQL for `identity` on port `5433`
- PostgreSQL for `fitness_management_system` on port `5434`
- Kafka on port `9092`
- Axon Server is not used in this setup

## Prerequisites

- Java 25
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Maven 3.9+ or the included Maven wrappers

To enable the agent, create a free Gemini API key and configure it locally:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add GOOGLE_API_KEY to .env
```

Without a key, the complete stack still starts and the agent endpoint returns `503 Service Unavailable`.

Use the root Maven wrapper for the multi-module build:

```bash
./mvnw -Ddocker.compose.skip=true clean verify
```

## Start The System

### One-click start

Double-click [`start-dev.command`](./start-dev.command), or run:

```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

In IntelliJ, use the shared `Start All` run configuration.

This builds and starts PostgreSQL, Kafka, both Spring Boot services, and the Angular staff console in Docker. Open
`http://localhost:4200` after the services are ready. Stop the stack with `Ctrl-C`; remove it with
`docker compose down`.

### Infrastructure-only or IDE development

```bash
docker compose up identity-db fitness-management-db kafka
```

This starts:

- `identity-db` on `localhost:5433`
- `fitness-management-db` on `localhost:5434`
- Kafka on `localhost:9092`

### 2. Start the `identity` service

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd identity
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 3. Start the `fitness_management_system` service

In another terminal:

```bash
cd fitness_management_system
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Request Files

The repo already contains IntelliJ HTTP client files under [`resources/requests`](./resources/requests):

- [`r_customer.http`](./resources/requests/r_customer.http)
- [`r_plans.http`](./resources/requests/r_plans.http)
- [`r_membership.http`](./resources/requests/r_membership.http)
- [`r_customer_cache.http`](./resources/requests/r_customer_cache.http)
- [`r_staff_assistant.http`](./resources/requests/r_staff_assistant.http)
- [`http-client.env.json`](./resources/requests/http-client.env.json)

These files store `customerId`, `planId`, and `membershipId` for the next requests.

The equivalent Postman collection can be found and imported from here:
[`resources/requests/postman/request_collection.json`](./resources/requests/postman/request_collection.json).

## Suggested Walkthrough

### 1. Create a customer in `identity`

Use [`r_customer.http`](./resources/requests/r_customer.http):

```http
POST http://localhost:8082/customers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "New Member",
  "dateOfBirth": "1987-08-12",
  "email": "info@codeartify.com"
}
```

### 2. Create a plan in `fitness_management_system`

Use [`r_plans.http`](./resources/requests/r_plans.http):

The customer registration event is consumed asynchronously by `fitness_management_system`.
If you run `fitness_management_system` without `identity` or without Kafka history, use
[`r_customer_cache.http`](./resources/requests/r_customer_cache.http) to backfill the customer cache before activating a
membership.

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/plans
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "1 Month",
  "description": "Flexible monthly membership plan.",
  "price": 139,
  "durationInMonths": 1
}
```

### 3. Activate a membership

Use [`r_membership.http`](./resources/requests/r_membership.http):

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/memberships/activate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "customerId": "{{customerId}}",
  "planId": "{{planId}}",
  "signedByGuardian": false
}
```

### 4. Query the membership projection

Membership read endpoints return the flat projection stored in PostgreSQL:

```http
GET http://localhost:8081/memberships
Accept: application/json
```

```http
GET http://localhost:8081/memberships/{{membershipId}}
Accept: application/json
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": "b84333b2-5ed9-4488-a0d7-edee5110bc20",
  "customerId": "customer-1",
  "planId": "b82a8402-0a42-463a-ad46-096804c25e53",
  "planDuration": 6,
  "planPrice": 599,
  "customerDateOfBirth": "1987-08-12",
  "guardianSignaturePresent": false,
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "pauseStartDate": null,
  "pauseEndDate": null,
  "pauseDurationDays": null
}
```

### 5. Continue the membership lifecycle

Pause an active membership:

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/memberships/{{membershipId}}/pause
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "durationInDays": 30
}
```

Resume a paused membership:

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/memberships/{{membershipId}}/resume
```

Suspend an active membership:

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/memberships/{{membershipId}}/suspend
```

Reactivate a suspended membership:

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/memberships/{{membershipId}}/reactivate
```

Cancel an active, paused, or suspended membership:

```http
DELETE http://localhost:8081/memberships/{{membershipId}}
```

## API Reference

### Customer API (`identity`, port `8082`)

| Method   | Path              | Description                                                |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `POST`   | `/customers`      | Create a customer and publish a customer integration event |
| `GET`    | `/customers`      | List customers                                             |
| `GET`    | `/customers/{id}` | Get one customer                                           |
| `PUT`    | `/customers/{id}` | Update a customer in the identity database                 |
| `DELETE` | `/customers/{id}` | Delete a customer                                          |

Create/update request body:

```json
{
  "name": "New Member",

{
  "customerId": "{{customerId}}",
  "planId": "{{planId}}",
  "signedByGuardian": false
}
```

Pause request body:

```json
{
  "durationInDays": 30
}
```

### Customer Cache API (`fitness_management_system`, port `8081`)

| Method | Path              | Description                                                             |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/customer-cache` | Backfill one customer into the fitness management system customer cache |

Request body:

```json
{
  "id": "{{customerId}}",
  "name": "New Member",
  "dateOfBirth": "1987-08-12",
  "email": "info@codeartify.com"
}
```

## Membership Lifecycle

| From State  | Command                | Event                   | To State    | Rule / Invariant                                                                     |

| `SUSPENDED` | `CancelMembership`     | `MembershipCancelled`   | `CANCELLED` | Suspended memberships can be cancelled                                               |
| `CANCELLED` | any transition command | rejected                | `CANCELLED` | Cancelled is terminal                                                                |

## Data Flow

At a high level:

1. `identity` creates customers.
2. Customer registrations are published to Kafka on `managing-customer.integration-events.v1`.
3. `fitness_management_system` consumes those customer integration events and keeps a local customer cache for
   membership operations.
4. `fitness_management_system` manages plans and membership lifecycle state.
5. Membership activation triggers downstream billing behavior inside the membership bounded context.

## Event Processing

`fitness_management_system` uses explicit Axon event processor definitions:

| Processor                   | Mode     | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `membership-invoice-policy` | pooled   | Handles billing policy events and issues invoices                       |
| `membership-projection`     | pooled   | Maintains the flat membership read model                                |
| `notifying-customers`       | pooled   | Sends invoice notifications; starts at the latest token if no token row exists |

The `notifying-customers` processor intentionally starts at the current end of the event stream when its token entry is
missing. This keeps deleted notification tokens from replaying historical invoice events and resending old emails.

Kafka customer-cache consumption is separate from Axon event processing and uses the consumer group
`managing-customer-readmodel`.

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions runs [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) on pushes and pull requests for the `solutions` branch.
The workflow uses Java 25, checks Docker availability, and runs:

```bash
mvn -B -ntp -Ddocker.compose.skip=true clean verify
```

## Notes

- Both services use PostgreSQL for data storage.
- `fitness_management_system` uses Axon with PostgreSQL-backed event storage.
- Kafka is used only for cross-service integration, not as the Axon event store.
